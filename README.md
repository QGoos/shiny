# Shiny

This is a fork of golang.org/exp/shiny. 
The goal of this fork is to add additional window management functionality, 
and otherwise actively maintain the project where it is not being maintained in
it's current form. 

## Long Term Plans 

1. Window, Screen, Input management improvements.
2. Probably moving UI packages somewhere else?
